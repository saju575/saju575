### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Sakil Ahmed

Hello there! I am a student of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University. Recently, I successfully completed my graduation, and I am excited about embarking on the next phase of my journey in the field of web development.

Web development has captured my interest, and I am currently focused on honing my skills in this area. Specifically, I have been delving into the MERN stack, which encompasses MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This comprehensive stack allows me to develop full-stack applications efficiently and effectively.

As I continue my learning journey, I am eager to apply my knowledge and gain practical experience in a professional setting. I am actively searching for job opportunities or paid internships where I can contribute my skills and passion for web development. I am enthusiastic about working with a team of experienced professionals to further enhance my abilities and contribute to meaningful projects.

Thank you for considering my profile, and I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in my web development career.
